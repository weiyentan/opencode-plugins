# AWX Plugin (`@opencode-ai/plugin-awx`)

OpenCode server plugin for [AWX](https://github.com/ansible/awx) / Ansible Automation Platform (AAP). Provides native tool access to job templates, projects, and job lifecycle operations.

## Status

✅ **Phase 0 — Repository Scaffolding** (complete)  
✅ **Phase 1 — Client Infrastructure** (complete)

The AWX plugin delivers these modules:

| Module | File | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Plugin entry** | `src/index.ts` | Registers hello-world + listTemplates tools; wires HTTP client, metrics lifecycle (load/persist/dispose), and dispose hook for plugin shutdown |
| **Auth hook** | `src/auth.ts` | Bearer token / PAT authentication via OpenCode's `type: "api"` auth hook with init-time validation |
| **Output contract** | `src/contracts/job-detail.ts` | Zod schemas and TypeScript types (`JobDetailOutput`) matching `awx_job_detail.py` v1.0 |
| **Transforms** | `src/transforms.ts` | Pure functions: SSH→HTTPS URL conversion, git branch inference, required-var validation |
| **Client middleware** | `src/client.ts` | HTTP middleware pipeline: circuit breaker, retry/backoff, timeout via native `fetch` |
| **Metrics** | `src/metrics.ts` | Per-tool counters with file-backed durability for operational visibility |
| **Node shim** | `src/node-shim.d.ts` | Minimal Node.js built-in declarations (avoids `@types/node` dependency) |
| **Snapshot generator** | `scripts/generate-snapshots.py` | Python script that regenerates contract snapshots from fixture data |

Tool implementation (Phase 2) begins next — see the [issue tracker](https://github.com/weiyentan/opencode-plugins/issues) for available issues. The client middleware pipeline (issue #5) and metrics module (issue #5) provide the HTTP infrastructure that tools will use.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0 (Node 18 compatibility is handled transparently — the client middleware includes `anyAbortSignal()` and `createTimeoutSignal()` fallbacks)
- **npm** >= 9.0.0 (ships with Node.js 18)
- TypeScript knowledge for plugin development
- Access to an AAP instance for integration testing (optional — unit tests run offline)

## Setup

```bash
# From the monorepo root:
npm install

# Or from this package directly:
cd packages/awx
npm install
```

This package is consumed by the OpenCode plugin server as a dependency — no standalone runtime is needed.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript to `dist/` (`tsc`) |
| `npm test` | Run the Vitest test suite (`vitest run`) |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode |
| `npm run lint` | Type-check without emitting (`tsc --noEmit`) |
| `npm run typecheck` | Alias for `lint` — strict type checking |

## Testing

```bash
# Unit tests (no AAP instance required)
npm test

# Integration tests (requires AAP instance and PAT)
export AWX_TOKEN=your_pat_token_here
npx vitest run tests/integration/
```

Tests follow TDD (test-driven development) with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) and verify behavior through the public plugin interface.

### Contract Tests

Contract tests (`tests/contract.test.ts`) validate that the TypeScript `JobDetailOutput` interface and zod schema match the Python `awx_job_detail.py` v1.0 output contract. A **snapshot-based approach** is used for CI safety:

- Fixture JSON files in `tests/fixtures/` represent pre-baked snapshots of the Python output contract.
- Tests parse each fixture through the zod schema and assert structural correctness.
- No live Python subprocess is executed — the tests are pure TypeScript and run in any CI environment.

#### Fixture Files

| Fixture | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `awx_job_success.json` | A successful job with no failures or unreachable hosts |
| `awx_job_partial.json` | A job that completed with some unreachable hosts |
| `awx_job_failure.json` | A failed job with task-level errors |

#### Regenerating Contract Snapshots

When the Python `awx_job_detail.py` v1.0 output contract changes (e.g., new fields are added or field types change), the fixture snapshots must be regenerated:

1. Run the Python `awx_job_detail.py` module against a live AAP instance to produce updated JSON output for each representative job state (success, partial, failure).
2. Replace the corresponding fixture files in `tests/fixtures/` with the new output.
3. Update `src/contracts/job-detail.ts` if the schema has changed (add/modify zod fields and TypeScript types).
4. Run `npm test` to verify the new snapshots pass schema validation.
5. Commit the updated fixtures and schema together — they must stay in lockstep.

> **Important**: Fixtures are checked into the repository. They serve as the canonical reference for what the Python output contract produces. If you change the Python code without updating the fixtures, contract tests will catch the mismatch.
## Hot-Reload

The OpenCode plugin server watches plugin source files and **automatically reloads** when changes are detected — no server restart required. This was verified during Phase 0 scaffolding:

1. The plugin is registered by the OpenCode server (consuming `src/index.ts` as the entry point).
2. Modifying the tool's `description` field in `src/index.ts` (e.g., changing the hello-world description text) triggers a plugin reload.
3. The server picks up the new description on the next tool invocation.

### Known Limitation (Phase 0)

At the scaffolding stage, hot-reload verification was performed structurally (the `tsc --noEmit` / `vitest run` cycle confirms the module compiles and tool execute signature is correct) but end-to-end hot-reload testing requires a running OpenCode server instance. Full integration testing of hot-reload behavior is tracked for a later phase.

### Dev-Mode Flag

The `package.json` `type` field is set to `"module"`, and the `main` / `exports` fields point directly to `src/index.ts`. This allows the OpenCode server to consume TypeScript source directly in development mode, bypassing the build step for faster iteration. When running in development:

```bash
# The OpenCode server watches src/ and reloads on change
# No explicit watch flag needed — this is the default plugin loading behavior
```

For production deployment, run `npm run build` to compile TypeScript into `dist/` and update the `main` field to point to the compiled output.

## CI Requirements

CI pipelines must run the following in order:

```bash
npm ci              # Clean install
npm run lint        # Type checking
npm test            # Unit tests
npm run build       # Production build
```

### Required CI Environment

- **Node.js** 18.x or 20.x LTS
- **npm** 9.x+
- No secrets required for unit tests (`npm test`)
- Integration tests are gated behind `AWX_TOKEN` and run separately

## Toolchain Decisions

### npm Workspaces (not pnpm)

This package lives inside an **npm workspaces** monorepo. The root `package.json` declares `packages/*` as workspaces. npm workspaces were chosen over pnpm for:

1. **Zero-install overhead** — npm ships with Node.js, no extra package manager needed.
2. **CI simplicity** — GitHub Actions runners include npm by default.
3. **Hoisting model** — npm's flat `node_modules` layout avoids pnpm's strict isolation issues with certain tool packages.

### Single tsconfig.json (not project references)

A single `tsconfig.json` at `packages/awx/tsconfig.json` is used instead of TypeScript project references (`references` + composite builds). This was chosen because:

1. **Single-package scope** — this is one package in a workspaces monorepo, not a multi-package composite build.
2. **Simplicity** — a single config is easier to author, debug, and integrate with Vitest (which resolves TypeScript via its own transform).
3. **Future readiness** — if the plugin is split into sub-packages (e.g., `packages/awx-core`, `packages/awx-transforms`), we will adopt project references at that point.

```

### Auth Hook

The plugin uses OpenCode's `type: "api"` auth hook for bearer token (Personal Access Token) authentication. On plugin load:

1. If a PAT was previously stored, init-time validation calls `GET /api/v2/me/` with a 10s timeout to verify the token is still active.
2. If validation fails, a clear actionable error is logged: "AWX token is invalid or expired."
3. If no token is stored yet, the plugin loads gracefully and the user is prompted when they first use an AWX tool.

### Output Contract

All job-related tools return output matching the `JobDetailOutput` interface (see `src/contracts/job-detail.ts`). This interface is the exact TypeScript representation of the `awx_job_detail.py` v1.0 schema. Key naming:

- Use `host_status_counts` — NOT `host_summary`
- Use `derived` — NOT `extra_vars_summary`
- `related` fields are resolved names, not raw URLs

See the [Architecture Decision Records](../../docs/adr/) in the monorepo for design rationale:

- **ADR 0001**: Auth strategy (bearer token / PAT)
- **ADR 0002**: Output contract schema
- **ADR 0003**: Resilience patterns (retry, timeout, circuit breaker)
- **ADR 0004**: Agent-side polling (job lifecycle)
- **ADR 0005**: Extra-variable transforms (SSH→HTTPS, branch inference)
- **ADR 0006**: Error taxonomy and structured error reporting
